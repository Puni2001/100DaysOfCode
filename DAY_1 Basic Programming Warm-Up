🎉 Day 1 of #100DaysOfCode! 🎉
Hey everyone, I'm taking on the challenge and starting my coding journey today. 💻

👩‍💻 Today's goal: Basic Programming Warm-Up
✨ I wrote my first program that prints "Hello, World!" on the screen. It's the small steps that count, right?

👀 Check out my screen! I'm so excited to see "Hello, World!" in action. 🌍

🗣️ It might seem simple, but these are the building blocks of coding. From declaring variables to performing arithmetic operations, I'm already feeling more confident.

🤝 Have you ever written your first program? Share your experience in the comments below!

🚀 Stay tuned for Day 2! I can't wait to tackle more challenges and share my progress with all of you. Remember to like, comment, and follow for more coding adventures. See you tomorrow! 👋
